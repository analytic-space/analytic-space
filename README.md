## 👋 Hello, I'm Sri!
### ✨  Welcome, to my Analytic Space!

🌱 I focus on everyday business intelligence, emphasizing 'empathetic information design' to prioritize and identify opportunities within business problems.

😄 Considering myself a minimalist, I enjoy learning and discussing technologies like ETL, SQL, and Cloud data engineering.

📊 This repository is a collection of my personal projects, showcasing my evolving skills as I learn.
